## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="cb_twitter.jpeg">

My name is Carol Bogezi and this is my professional site. I recently earned my PhD in Wildlife Science from the University of Washington. I am currently seeking employment opportunities to apply my expertise to conservation program management and applied research. If you have any questions, please contact me: [cbogezi@gmail.com](mailto:cbogezi@gmail.com).

## Research Interest
I recently earned my PhD in Environmental Science at the [University of Washington](http:/www.uw.edu)'s School of Environment and Forest Sciences [(SEFS)](http://www.cfr.washington.edu/). My Urban Ecology lab advisor [Dr. John Marzluff](http://apps.sefs.uw.edu/Public/People/FacultyProfile.aspx?PID=10) secured a grant for the ["Feasibility of a Wolf Economy"](https://reeis.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/0232727-feasibility-of-a-wolf-economy-for-washington.html) that formed the basis of my dissertation.

I perform interdisciplinary research on wildlife conservation issues integrating social, ecological, and geographic sciences. My dissertation focused on understanding human-carnivore interactions in Washington state, particularly wolves in the context of their recovery, and cougars in the context of their habitat and ranging needs overlap with human recreation and habitation.

Previously, I undertook ecological research on *Crocodylus suchus* in Kidepo National Park in northeast Uganda. This crocodile population was discovered at the easternmost extent of this subspecies' range. I investigated the habitat occupancy within sub-basins in and around Kidepo.
