<p><img class="profile-picture" src="cb_twitter.jpeg" /></p>

<p>My name is Carol Bogezi and this is my professional site. I recently earned my PhD in Wildlife Science from the University of Washington. I am currently seeking employment opportunities to apply my expertise to conservation program management and applied research. If you have any questions, please contact me: <a href="mailto:cbogezi@gmail.com">cbogezi@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>
<p>I recently earned my PhD in Environmental Science at the <a href="http:/www.uw.edu">University of Washington</a>‚Äôs School of Environment and Forest Sciences <a href="http://www.cfr.washington.edu/">(SEFS)</a>. My Urban Ecology lab advisor <a href="http://apps.sefs.uw.edu/Public/People/FacultyProfile.aspx?PID=10">Dr. John Marzluff</a> secured a grant for the <a href="https://reeis.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/0232727-feasibility-of-a-wolf-economy-for-washington.html">‚ÄúFeasibility of a Wolf Economy‚Äù</a> that formed the basis of my dissertation.</p>

<p>I perform interdisciplinary research on wildlife conservation issues integrating social, ecological, and geographic sciences. My dissertation focused on understanding human-carnivore interactions in Washington state, particularly wolves in the context of their recovery, and cougars in the context of their habitat and ranging needs overlap with human recreation and habitation.</p>

<p>Previously, I undertook ecological research on <em>Crocodylus suchus</em> in Kidepo National Park in northeast Uganda. This crocodile population was discovered at the easternmost extent of this subspecies‚Äô range. I investigated the habitat occupancy within sub-basins in and around Kidepo.</p>
